/**
 * In-isolate request metrics, flushed as aggregates.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT: a request must not write to the database to be measured.
 *
 * A signup already costs 15-17 round trips and a dashboard view 17-29. Adding a
 * telemetry insert to each would make observing the system the most expensive
 * thing it does, and the table would grow fastest exactly when traffic spiked —
 * the worst possible coupling.
 *
 * So this accumulates counters in module scope, which in a Worker means "for as
 * long as this isolate lives", and writes one row per flush interval per
 * isolate. At early-access volume that is a handful of writes an hour, against
 * thousands of requests.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY GIVEN UP
 * -----------------------------
 * An isolate can be discarded at any moment, taking unflushed counters with it.
 * That is accepted: these are operational trends, not an audit trail, and a
 * slightly low request count on a quiet hour changes no decision. Anything that
 * must not be lost — credits, consent, admin actions — is written
 * transactionally by the handler, never through here.
 *
 * WHY A HISTOGRAM AND NOT A PERCENTILE
 * ------------------------------------
 * Percentiles do not merge. Several isolates serve traffic simultaneously and
 * each reports separately; averaging two p95 values yields a number that is not
 * the p95 of anything. Bucket counts add, so the merged histogram is exact and
 * the percentile is computed from it at read time.
